Jack compiler...
I am gonna transform a copy of jack analyzer (I mean https://github.com/Aeroel/JackAnalyzer ) into a compiler.
To clarify, the compiler does this: transform jack files into vm files (nand2tetris course)

Currently, I am in the process of, well... writing the compiler.
It is currently non-functional, I think. Or, at least, it just produces the same results of XML tokens as jackanalyzer.
I am gonna stop now and continue later.
Generally, it seems likely that this jack compiler writing task will be quite easy and manageable.

UPDATE: So, now the compiler seems to work fully, at least in terms of being able to successfully run all the test programs with expected behaviours identical (so it would seem) to the same programs compiled using the default course-provided compiler (I am referring to JackCompiler.bat). I thought I noticed a slight speed difference in my square mov speed versus the provided square move speed, but this is probably illusory.
So, good work! Yay!
