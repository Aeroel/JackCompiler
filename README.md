Jack compiler...
I am gonna transform a copy of jack analyzer into a compiler.
To clarify, the compiler does this: transform jack files into vm files (nand2tetris course)

Currently, I am in the process of, well... writing the compiler.
It is currently non-functional, I think. Or, at least, it just produces the same results of XML tokens as jackanalyzer.
I am gonna stop now and continue later.
Generally, it seems likely that this jack compiler writing task will be quite easy and manageable.
